CameraFeed
==========

**Inherits:** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A camera feed gives you access to a single physical camera attached to your device.

Description
-----------

A camera feed gives you access to a single physical camera attached to your device. When enabled, Godot will start capturing frames from the camera which can then be used.

**Note:** Many cameras will return YCbCr images which are split into two textures and need to be combined in a shader. Godot does this automatically for you if you set the environment to show the camera image in the background.
